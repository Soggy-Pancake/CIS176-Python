This is my repo for all of my Python programming class assignments. `Main.py` imports and lists all assignments made under the `Assignments` folder with a menu to select and run them. 

# Folder Structure
Each assignment is imported as a module. Assignment folders are named based on chapter number and its programming exercize number. For example `Ch1_PE1` for Chapter 1 Programming Exercise 1. 

# Assignment Structure
Each assignment has a `main()` and `fullAssignmentName()` inside of the `__init__.py`. 
`fullAssignmentName()` is used to display the full assignment name instead of the shortened assignment folder name.

Each assignment can be run seperately using the `__init__.py` by running it directly.
